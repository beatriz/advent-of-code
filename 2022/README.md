# Advent of Code 2022

This year's solutions will be implemented in Scala 3. 

### Instructions

This can be compiled with:

```
$ sbt compile
```

To run the solver, run the following command, replacing `XX` with the day of the desired problem:

```
$ sbt run XX
```

Additionally, any solver can be ran with an input file "test.txt", by passing `true` as the second parameter:

```
$ sbt run XX true
```
