# Advent of Code
These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems.

I've been solving as many problems as I can during the duration of the month of December and, sometimes, come back later to solve some more.

I don't use the same programming language every year, these are the used ones per year so far:
- [2022](/2022): Scala
- [2021](/2021): TypeScript
- [2020](/2020): Scala
- [2019](/2019): Javascript
- [2018](/2018): Scala
- [2017](/2017): Ruby
