# Advent of Code 2021

This year, I'll be implementing the solutions in TypeScript.

## Instructions
You need to install the necessary dependencies before running:

```
$ yarn install
```

You can then run them with the following command, replacing `XX` with the day of the desired problem:
```
$ yarn start XX
```
